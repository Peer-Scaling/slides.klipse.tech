== What is pattern matching?

>  Pattern matching is the act of checking a given sequence of tokens for the presence of the constituents of some pattern. Uses of pattern matching include outputting component of the matched pattern.

It is built-in in some languages e.g. Scala, Haskell and ML.



In clojure, it is provided by `core.match`: the algorithm is based  Luc Marangetâ€™s paper http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/cs257/archive/luc-maranget/jun08.pdf[Compiling Pattern Matching to good Decision Trees].

A gentle description of the algorithm is provided in https://github.com/clojure/core.match/wiki/Understanding-the-algorithm[core.match wiki].

== core.match

We have to require the `match` macro from `core.match`:

[source, role="clj"]
----
(require '[cljs.core.match :refer-macros [match]])
----

It has been made clojurescript self-host compatible by the author of Klipse.

Please vote for this http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/MATCH-116[Clojure JIRA ticket]!

== Matching literals

The simplest -and most useful - thing you can do is match literals:

[source,role="clj"]
----
(let [x true
      y true
      z true]
  (match [x y z]
         [_ false true] 1
         [false true _ ] 2
         [_ _ false] 3
         [_ _ true] 4
         :else 5))
----

[%step]
--
Exercise: Write the same code without pattern matching (Enjoy!).
[source, role="clj"]
----
(let [x true
      y true
      z true])
----

== Pattern matching - Binding and variants

You may match values and give them names for later use:

[source, role="clj"]
----
(let [x 1 y 2]
  (match [x y]
         [1 b] b
         [a 2] a
         :else nil))
----


[%step]
--
++++
<br/>
<br/>
++++

Real-life example: A function `read-from-db` that could fail returns a pair `[status val]`.

(This is called a variant and it is explained in detailed in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQkIWWTygio[Variants are Not Unions].)

[source, role="clj"]
----
(defn read-from-db []
  (rand-nth [[:ok 42]
             [:error "Bad query"]
             [:error "Bad credentials"]]))
----
--

[%step]
--
Here is how a caller of `read-from-db` might look like:
[source, role="clj"]
----
(match (read-from-db)
       [:ok res] res
       [:error err] (str "An error occured: " err)
       :else nil)            
----

++++
<br/>
++++

This is super useful!

== Pattern Matching - Summary: the power of variants


Let's implement our own recursion runner - as it is suggested in this amazing talk: https://youtu.be/ZQkIWWTygio?t=24m54s[Variants are Not Unions].


[source, role="clj"]
----
(defn run [f init]
  (loop [args init]
    (println "[run]" args)
    (match (f args)
           [:recur x] (recur x)
           [:stop x] x)))
----


[%step]
--
++++
<br/>
++++
Let's define the factorial tail call recursive function using our new semantics:

* `[:recur x]` instead of `(recur x)`
* `[:stop res` instead of `res`


[source, role="clj"]
----
(defn factorial [x]
  (run (fn [[n res]]
         (if (= n 1)
           [:stop res]
           [:recur [(dec n) (* n res)]]))
       [x 1]))
----
--

[%step]
--
++++
<br/>
++++
It works!!!

[source, role="clj"]
----
(factorial 5)
----
--

[%step]
--
++++
<br/>
++++
Now tweak the runner in order to get more control of the iterations.

For instance:

* limit the number of iterations
* print the values of the iteration once in a while

== Exercise - FizzBuzz

Solve FizzBuzz with pattern matching:

[source, role="clj"]
----
(defn fizz-buzz [n])
----

++++
<br/>
++++


[source, role="clj"]
----
(fizz-buzz 19)
----

== core.match - what else?

There are much more features available for pattern matching.
