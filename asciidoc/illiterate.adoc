== The problems from the readers perspective

[%step]
--
Problem 0: Readers are not as [.line-through]#smart# familiar with the concepts as the blog author.

They cannot digest complex code just by meditating at it.
They need to interact with it.
--

[%step]
--
Problem 1: Readers are lazy.
Noboding is going to clone your github repo to interact with the code you have linked to in your blog post.
--

[%step]
--
[.line-through]#Problem# Fact 2: Readers are kids.
They love to play.
--



== The solution

[custom-quote]#Illiterate blogging with https://github.com/viebel/klipse[Klipse]#

[%step]
--
*Literate Programming*: Embedding of natural language sentences in a program.

*Illiterate Blogging*: Embedding of interactive code snippets in a blog post.
--

== Klipse demo

- http://blog.klipse.tech/clojure/2016/09/30/automata-segments-1.html[Interactive version of solving riddles with automata]
- http://blog.klipse.tech/javascript/2016/12/19/es2017-entries.html[Interactive version of ES proposal: Object.entries() and Object.values()]
- http://exupero.org/hazard/post/fractals/[An interactive blog post about fractals] by https://twitter.com/exupero[@exupero].

== Klipse: How does it work?

The klipse plugin is a javascript tag that transforms static code snippets of an html page into live and interactive snippets:

- *Live*: The code is executed in your browser
- *Interactive*: The reader can modify the code and it is evaluated as she types

The code evaluation is done in the browser: no server is involved at all!

== Klipse: The features

[%step]
- code is evaluated as you type (configurable)
- supports many languages: clojure, javascript (es7, jsx, react), ruby, python, brainfuck, scheme...
- clojurescript transpilation
- environment is shared between code snippets
- hidden code snippets
- snippet preamble	
- printing
- code evaluation in a loop
- load code from a github gist
- interacting with the DOM
- the CodeMirror editor is configurable: options and CSS

[%step]
- caching of external libs: core.async
- custom external libraries
- limited size printing
- infinite loop partial prevention
- reagent snippets
- output is beautified and strings are beautified

== Klipse: code is evaluated as you type

Zero-delay between the trial and the result is key for *creativity*.

== Klipse: javascript


[%step]

Demonstrate EcmaScript 2017 features before they are available in the browser


[source.es2017]
----
const cond = true;
const obj = {
  ...(cond ? {a: 1} : {}),
  b: 2,
};
obj
----
ES2017 code is transpiled by https://github.com/babel/babel-standalone[babel-standalone].

[%step]

`console.log` is redirected to the result box

[source.eval-js]

console.log("Hello World!")

[%step]
--
Let's escape the callback hell!
`async` and `await` in action
++++
<pre><code class="eval-js" data-async-code="true">
async function sleep(ms = 0) {
  return new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, ms));
}

async function run() {
  console.log("Before: " + (new Date()).toString());
  await sleep(1000);
  console.log("After:  " + (new Date()).toString());
}

run();
</code></pre>

Each snippet is bounded to a klipse container accessible through `window.klipse_container` with id `window.klipse_container_id`.
[source.eval-js]
----
$(klipse_container)
  .css({color: 'white',
        backgroundColor: 'blue',
        padding: '10px',
        fontSize: '50px'})
  .text("Hello World")

== Klipse: react.js and JSX

[%step]
--
JSX is a language for writing `react` components almost in HTML 
--

[%step]
--
It is transpiled into plain javascript
[source.transpile-jsx]
----
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
----
--

[%step]
--
We can mix static and dynamic pieces of code
[source.render-jsx]
----
<p style= {{color:"blue"} }>Hello, world -- 14*3={14*3}!</p>
----
--

[%step]
--
Let's leverage the functional power of javascript
[source.render-jsx]
----
<div>
  {[1,2,3].map(i => 
               <p style= {{color:"blue"} }>Hello, world -- 14*{i}={14*i}!</p>
              )}
</div>
----
--

[%step]
--
JSX code is transpiled by https://github.com/babel/babel-standalone[babel-standalone].

Learn more about JSX in this http://blog.klipse.tech/javascript/2016/12/14/jsx.html[interactive JSX tutorial].

== Klipse: Ruby

[%step]
--

[source.ruby]
----
[1,2]*10
----

The evaluation of ruby code in the browser is powered by http://opalrb.org/[Opal].
--

== Klipse: Scheme

[%step]
--
Scheme
[source.scheme]
----
(let ((a 1)
  (b 2))
  (+ a b))
----
--

[%step]
--
Let's enjoy a bit of code from https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html[SICP]: Recursion vs. Iteration.
--

[%step]
--
Factorial implemented with recursion

[source.scheme]
----
(define (factorial-rec n)
  (if (= n 1)
      1
      (* n (factorial-rec (- n 1)))))

(factorial-rec 5)
----
--

[%step]
--
Factorial implemented with iteration (a.k.a tail-call recursion)

[source.scheme]
----
(define (factorial-iter n)
  (fact-iter-inner 1 1 n))

(define (fact-iter-inner product counter max-count)
  (if (> counter max-count)
      product
      (fact-iter-inner (* counter product)
                 (+ counter 1)
                 max-count)))

(factorial-iter 5)
----
--

[%step]
--
Learn more about schem in this http://blog.klipse.tech/scheme/2016/09/11/scheme-tutorial-1.html[Interactive overview of Scheme's semantics].
The evaluation of scheme code in the browser is powered by http://www.biwascheme.org/[BiwaScheme].
--

== Klipse: Scheme - fun with car and cdr



== Klipse: Lua (implemented in WebAssembly)

[%step]
--
[source.lua]
----
function hello(s)
  print("Hello " .. s)
end

print("Hello " .. "World!")
----

The evaluation of lua code in the browser is powered by https://github.com/vvanders/wasm_lua[wasm_lua].
--

== Klipse: Python

[%step]
--

Python
[source.python]
----
print([x + 1 for x in range(10)])
----
--


[%step]
--

Python Turtle
[source.python]
----
import turtle

t = turtle.Turtle()

for i in range(4):
	t.forward(150)
	t.left(90) 
----
--

[%step]
--
You can even http://blog.klipse.tech/python/2017/01/04/python-turtle-fractal.html[draw fractals] with the python turtle.

The evaluation of python code in the browser is powered by https://github.com/skulpt/skulpt[Skulpt].
--

== Klipse: environment is shared between Klipse snippets

A blog post is a story.

The different elements of the stories need to be connected together.

[%step]
--
Let's see how to write a *Hello World* function in Clojure:

[source.clj]
----
(defn hello [name]
  (str "hello " name "\n"))
----
--
[%step]
--
And now, let's see how to use this function:
[source.clj]
----
(hello "Klipse")
----
--
[%step]
--

☕You can embed a `jsfiddle` or a `codepen` in a blog post with an `<iframe>`.
But you cannot share neither code nor data between the iframes.

== Klipse: the challenges

- Clojurescript is not clojure: threads, types, core.async...
- Self-Host Clojurescript is not Clojurescript: many libs are not yet ported (core.logic, core.matrix...)
- Security issues for blogging platform
- Infinite loops


== Klipse: The integration

== Survey

[%step]

- How many people are bloggers?
- How many people have a github repository?
- Are you a programmer of type 0 or type 1?
- How many people read blogs?

== What's in it for you?

[%step]
- Ask from bloggers to _klipsify_ their articles
- Give a star to https://github.com/viebel/klipse[Klipse on Github]
- Share the world about code interactivty with your friends
- Write an interactive blog post: It's the best way to learn a topic and It's really fun!
- Klipsify a tutorial, a scientific paper, a blog post...
- Klipsify your library documentation
