== Agenda

- How programmers traditionnaly tell stories?
- Problems with the traditional approach
- What is Illiterate blogging?
- Examples of Illiterate blogging
- What's in it for you

== Two types of programmers - type 0

[%step]
- Programmers of type 0 love code
- Programmers of type 0 are very smart
- Programmers of type 0 share their ideas in github repos

== Two types of programmers - type 1
[%step]
- Programmers of type 1 love words
- Programmers of type 1 express themselves very well
- Programmers of type 1 share their ideas in blog posts

[%step]

[%step]
image::images/automata-comments.png[code]

image::images/es-image.png[code]

== All Programmers of type 1
[%step]
How do *all* programmers of type 0 make their code interactive?

[%step]

[%step]

== The problems from the readers perspective

[%step]
--
Problem 0: Readers are not as [.line-through]#smart# familiar with the concepts as the blog author.

They cannot digest complex code just by meditating at it.
They need to interact with it.
--

[%step]
--
Problem 1: Readers are lazy.
Noboding is going to clone your github repo and execute `lein run` to interact with the code you have linked to in your blog post.
--

[%step]
--
[.line-through]#Problem# Fact 2: Readers are kids.
They love to play.
--



== The solution

[custom-quote]#Illiterate blogging with https://github.com/viebel/klipse[Klipse]#

[%step]
--
*Literate Programming*: Embedding of natural language sentences in a program.

*Illiterate Blogging*: Embedding of interactive code snippets in a blog post.
--

== Klipse demo

- http://blog.klipse.tech/clojure/2016/09/30/automata-segments-1.html[Interactive version of solving riddles with automata]
- http://blog.klipse.tech/javascript/2016/12/19/es2017-entries.html[Interactive version of ES proposal: Object.entries() and Object.values()]
- http://exupero.org/hazard/post/fractals/[An interactive blog post about fractals] by https://twitter.com/exupero[@exupero].

== Klipse: How does it work?

The klipse plugin is a javascript tag that transforms static code snippets of an html page into live and interactive snippets:

- *Live*: The code is executed in your browser
- *Interactive*: The reader can modify the code and it is evaluated as she types

The code evaluation is done in the browser: no server is involved at all!

== Klipse: The features

[%step]
- code is evaluated as you type (configurable)
- supports many languages: clojure, javascript (es7, jsx, react), ruby, python, brainfuck, scheme...
- clojurescript transpilation
- environment is shared between code snippets
- hidden code snippets
- snippet preamble	
- printing
- output is beautified and strings are beautified
- external libraries
- core.async
- limited size printing
- infinite loop partial prevention
- code evaluation in a loop
- interacting with the DOM
- reagent snippets
- the CodeMirror editor is configurable: options and CSS

== Klipse: code is evaluated as you type

Zero-delay between the code editing and it's evaluation is key for creativity.

The evaluation of ruby code in the browser is powered by http://opalrb.org/[Opal].

Python Turtle
[source.python]

import turtle

t = turtle.Turtle()

for i in range(4):

You can even http://blog.klipse.tech/python/2017/01/04/python-turtle-fractal.html[draw fractals] with the python turtle.

The evaluation of python code in the browser is powered by https://github.com/skulpt/skulpt[Skulpt].

== Klipse: environment is shared between Klipse snippets

A blog post is a story.

The different elements of the stories need to be connected together.

[%step]
--
Let's show how to write a *Hello World* function in Clojure:

[source.clj]
----
(defn hello [name]
  (str "hello " name "\n"))
----
--
[%step]
--
And now, let's see how to use this function:
[source.clj]
----
(hello "Klipse")
----
--
[%step]

â˜•You can embed a `jsfiddle` or a `codepen` in a blog post with an `<iframe>`.
But you cannot share neither code nor data between the iframes.

== Klipse: the challenges

- Clojurescript is not clojure: threads, types, core.async...
- Self-Host Clojurescript is not Clojurescript: many libs are not yet ported (core.logic, core.matrix...)
- Security issues for blogging platform
- Infinite loops


== Klipse: The integration

== Survey

[%step]

- How many people are bloggers?
- How many people have a github repository?
- Are you a programmer of type 0 or type 1?
- How many people read blogs?

== What's in it for you?

[%step]
- Ask from bloggers to _klipsify_ their articles
- Write an interactive blog post: It's the best way to learn a topic and It's really fun!
- Klipsify a tutorial, a scientific paper, a blog post...
- Klipsify your library documentation 

== Interlude: What is self-host ClojureScript?
