== Agenda

- The Paradigms of Functional Programming
- A brief history of Functional Programming
- Functional Programming in practice
- Discussion and Questions

== The paradigms of Functional Programming

* Functions are first class citizens
* Declarative
* Pure Functions
* Immutability
* Laziness

== Functions - first class citizens

[%step]
--
* Functions can be passed to variable definitions
* Functions can be passed as arguments to functions
--

[%step]
--
set a function into a var in js
--

[%step]
--
map in js
--

[%step]
--
comp in clojure
--

[%step]
--
partial in clojure
--

== Pure functions

A pure Function depends only on its parameters (not on a global state)
A pure function has no side effect

Examples of pure and not pure

== Declarative programming

compare for vs. each
you don't care about how the iteration is done
you care about what to to do with each element

== Immutability

Instead of mutating an object, you create a new version of it

== Laziness

We can deal with infinite sequences

<h3>1930: λ-calculus</h3>
++++
* Alonzo Church discovers the  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus[λ-calculus]
* Everything is a function
* Even numbers!

<h3>1958: LISP</h3>
++++
* John McCarthy invents https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)[LISP]
* It is the 1st FP language
* Everything is a S-Expression: `(+ 1 2 3)` instead of `1 + 2 + 3` or `+(1,2,3)`
* Only 7 terms: CAR, CDR, ATOM, LAMBDA, LABEL, COND, QUOTE

<h3>1995: Javascript the language of the browser</h3>
++++
* Brendan Eich is recruited by Netscape to do "scheme in the browser"
* Eventually, he invents Javascript
* Functions are 1st class citizens

== A brief history of Functional Programming (cont.)

* 2004 - Martin Odersky invents Scala - A JVM statically typed language with functional programming support
* 2007 - Rich Hickey invents Clojure - A practical dialect of LISP on top of JVM
* 2013 - Facebook creates react.js - A functional javascript frontend framework
* 2015 - Dan Abramov invents redux - A javascript library that imposes FP constraints on a frontend app
 
== Functional Programming in practice - Frontend

Many functional languages are transpiled in Javascript: Clojure, Scala, F#, Ocaml.

== Functional Programming in practice - ClojureScript

The power of Clojure in the browser!

== Functional Programming in practice - React.js

The UI is a (pure) function of the state (virtual DOM).
Do not mutate the state.
Write functions that manipulate the state instead of the DOM.
The framework will update the DOM efficiently.

== Functional Programming in practice - Redux

* Single source of truth
* State is read-only
* Changes are made with pure functions


== Functional Programming in practice - Backend (Web server, micro services)

The development process of a web server is much more effective with languages that support functional programming e.g. ruby.

Much less boilerplate: no need to write everything in an object.
Much simpler to manipulate data with maps (dictionaries) and arrays.

Sometimes, you need to leverage the java ecosystem.
No problem, let's build a functional that is compiled into Java ByteCode and creates a syntax for *interop*: interacting with the hosting language.

Scala, Clojure.

== Functional Programming in practice - Big Data

When we need to write a (relatively small) worker that is part of a computation pipe, we need a language:

- lightweight
- easy to manipulate JSON-like data
- combine functions
- immutability is effective
- stateless

Examples: Spark (scala), Storm (Clojure), Onyx (Clojure)
